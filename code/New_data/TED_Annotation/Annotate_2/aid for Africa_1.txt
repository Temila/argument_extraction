The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid, something akin to the Marshall Plan.

Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?

Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.

And, as a consequence, the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.

Africa has received many opportunities.

The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair.
