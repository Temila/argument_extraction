Over our lifetimes, we've all contributed to climate change.

Actions, choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

But we can also turn that thought on its head, and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already, then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to.We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously, and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future.
Alternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem.But if we do that, we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future.

But dangerous climate change can be subjective.

But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure, or where people are not well-insured, or they're not having good support networks, then that same climate change impact could be devastating.

It can cause upset, it could cause cost.

It could even cause some deaths.

But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems, on food systems, aviation and also shipping, just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change.

So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011 where we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change, economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations.
