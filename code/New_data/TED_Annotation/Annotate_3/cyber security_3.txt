These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.

I'll quote General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction.

Yet, what you'll never hear from spokespeople from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence is that the question isn't really who's the enemy, but actually the very nature of cyber weapons.

So military technologies can influence the course of the world, can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cyber weapons.

Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature: they can be used without leaving traces.

So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature, but in addition, they're emerging in a much more unstable environment.

Today we're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated, as we have seen at Copenhagen.And this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons.

Cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons -- they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.But in doing so, they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict -- as we've just seen, a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us: European allies, NATO members, our American friends and allies, our other Western allies, and maybe, by forcing their hand a little, our Russian and Chinese partners.
