We know how fear feels, but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean.

And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination.

As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates.

In English, fear is something we conquer.

It's something we fight.

It's something we overcome.

It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do.

In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

And fears and storytelling have the same components.

They have the same architecture.

Like all stories, fears have characters.

Fears also have plots.

They have beginnings and middles and ends.

Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance, a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.

Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature: a little wisdom, a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth.
