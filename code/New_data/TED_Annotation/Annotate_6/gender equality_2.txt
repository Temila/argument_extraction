(Laughter)  So let me be very clear: white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world.

Of course, it's fair, it's right and it's just.

But more than that, gender equality is also in our interest as men.

If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives, gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live.

Now, it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships, the happier both partners are.

So, what we found is something really important, that gender equality is in the interest of countries, of companies, and of men, and their children and their partners, that gender equality is not a zero-sum game.

It's not a win-lose.

It is a win-win for everyone.

And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live.

And this was the first line of that article: "Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free."
