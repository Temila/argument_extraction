It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment.

In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.

First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures.

Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet.

Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.

In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas.

However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.
