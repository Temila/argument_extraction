There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States

So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality.

Now, when men first hear about gender equality, when they first start thinking about it, they often think, many men think, well, that's right, that's fair, that's just, that's the ethical imperative.

gender equality is also in our interest as men.

Gender equality is good for countries.

If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives, gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live.

It turns out, according to most studies, that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale.

Even within Europe, those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness.

Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are, the better it is for workers, the happier their labor force is.

I think we have the persuasive numbers, the data, to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.

So, what we found is something really important, that gender equality is in the interest of countries, of companies, and of men, and their children and their partners, that gender equality is not a zero-sum game.
