The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.

The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.

The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath, or not, and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.

So, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens.

We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air.
