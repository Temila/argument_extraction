The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world.

(While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries), I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations.

Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination countryâ€™s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists.

To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries.
