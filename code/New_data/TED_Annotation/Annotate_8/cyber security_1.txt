However, this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons.

It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.


I'll quote General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction.
Yet, what you'll never hear from spokespeople from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence is that the question isn't really who's the enemy, but actually the very nature of cyber weapons.


Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature: they can be used without leaving traces.


This is the environment that's being created by cyber weapons today, and historically it was the environment in Europe at the onset of World War I.


So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature, but in addition, they're emerging in a much more unstable environment.



Cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons -- they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.
