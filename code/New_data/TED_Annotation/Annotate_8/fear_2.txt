As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates.

And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination.

But at a certain point, most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do.

Like all stories, fears have characters.

Fears also have suspense

In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature: What will happen next?


So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories, we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories.

But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears, and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.


Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance, a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.


Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature: a little wisdom, a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth.
