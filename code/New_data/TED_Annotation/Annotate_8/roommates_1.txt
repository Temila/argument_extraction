Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate.

In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered.

In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate.

At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously.

Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life.
Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate.
