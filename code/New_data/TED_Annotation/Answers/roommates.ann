Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality
the most important quality of roommates is being considered
communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate
At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously
having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life
communication is as well making a good roommate
If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk
