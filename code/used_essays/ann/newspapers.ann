newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence
the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information
to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers
Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime
As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages	
the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time
from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one
the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries
The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so
newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive
when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down
This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today
