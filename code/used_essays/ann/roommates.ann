Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality
the most important quality of roommates is being considered
communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate
Consideration is always important in relationship
roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time
Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine
At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously
having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life
It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member
communication is as well making a good roommate
If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk
